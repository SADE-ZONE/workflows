# Reputation Model Profile

Each field below represents one column in a profile row. Widths in brackets are the intended fixed length for serialized records.
THIS IS OPEN FOR DISCUSSION AND CHANGE UNTIL Wednesday August 6th AOE.  If we can discuss and agree early then we can freeze sooner!

## Serialization Guidance

- Fields with a width in brackets are fixed-length when serialized. Pad numbers left with zero as needed (e.g., `8` → `08`).
- Use **ISO 8601** for timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) and store in UTC if possible.
- `Incidents` are a list of strings, format `hhhh-sss`, where:
  - `hhhh` = high-level code
  - `sss` = sub-code (3 digits)
- `Entry_decision`:
  - `01` = Admit  
  - `00` = Deny  
  - `10` = Admit with conditions  
  - Followed by an **8-character condition payload**, e.g.:
    - `00100008` → Velocity restriction, max speed 8 m/s  
    - `01000030` → Altitude restriction, <30 m  
- Any incident triggers a required follow-up report with `UUID-2`.
